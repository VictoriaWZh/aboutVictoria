            <h1>Scientific Thinking 3</h1>
            <p>
                This course provides an exhilarating and intellectually stimulating journey through a series of rigorous scientific investigations, meticulously designed to empower students with a deep comprehension of the intricate interplay of Earth's complex systems. It also delves into humanity's connection with our planet and its broader relationship within the cosmos. Students are actively immersed in hands-on laboratory work and experimental design, complemented by insightful readings and engaging class discussions. These explorations span a wide spectrum of scientific disciplines, including astronomy, oceanography, meteorology, and geology. By combining these practical experiences with theoretical knowledge, students acquire a solid foundation that lays the groundwork for their future endeavors in Upper School science courses. Throughout this course, students not only cultivate a profound appreciation for the natural world but also hone their critical thinking, problem-solving, and analytical skills, preparing them to navigate the complexities of scientific inquiry and contribute meaningfully to our understanding of the universe and our place within it.

            <h1>Literary Thinking 3</h1>
            <p>
                The 8th grade Essential Question is What Does It Mean to Be Human? and this theme will guide our explorations in LT3 and our overlapping Humanities connections with HT3, ST3, and everything else in the universe.  Working from Martel’s Life of Pi, Collins' Hunger Games, and Mitchell's Hadestown, plus selections from contemporary poetry, students work towards becoming more critical readers, deliberate writers, and compassionate citizens.  In the course, students hone writing skills through creative pieces, journals, personal narratives, and analysis papers.  Our writing focus is rooted in the LT3 Sentence Appreciation Project, and this year we will also focus on autonomous literary learning in the inaugural LT3 Lit Shop during winter trimester.  Throughout the year, we will enhance our use of the English language with focused work on grammatical concepts and vocabulary acquisition.

                In this course, we delve into the dynamic realm of the web, which constitutes a pivotal aspect of the expansive internet landscape. Yet, our exploration goes beyond the web, encompassing the entire intricacy of the internet. Our primary objective revolves around unraveling a fundamental question: What defines the internet, and how does it function? Throughout this educational journey, we embark on a comprehensive investigation into the internet's origins, the underlying technologies, the intricate protocols, and the infrastructure that enables its worldwide connectivity. Additionally, we scrutinize the profound societal impact of the internet, ranging from its transformative influence on communication and information exchange to its far-reaching effects on commerce, education, and cultural dynamics. By the culmination of this course, you will have acquired a comprehensive comprehension of the internet and its pivotal role in our interconnected global landscape, equipping you with the knowledge needed to navigate the digital world effectively.
