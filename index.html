            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Victoria Zhang. I am 14 years old, and I am currently attending 8th grade at Eastside Preparatory School. My hometown is Denton, Texas, which I don't have any memories of. My favorite place I have ever visited is Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada because of all the breathtaking views, flourishing wildlife, and serene environment: the medley of mountains, lakes, wildflowers, and other scenery make Banff simply spectacular.
            </p>

                My favorite season would be fall, since my birthday (September 22) generally falls on the first day (Fall Equinox). I treasure the cozy vibes and the remarkable spectrum of leaves turning colors, falling off trees and covering the ground with a gorgeous pattern of reds, oranges, and yellows. My favorite book is "The Glass Castle" by Jeanette Walls, and although it is an older classic, the biography and story intrigues me.

                I can speak English and Chinese both fluently, and a bit of Spanish. My hobbies would include reading, writing (short stories), coding in Python/Java, and Equestrianism. I am an avid equestrian: I ride horses and am a D2 Eventer in the USPC, working towards becoming D3 certified. Related to this sport I'm passionate about, comes my favorite quote: "Head up, heels down.", which explains such a simple four-word riding tip, but also as a powerful attitude towards life in general.
