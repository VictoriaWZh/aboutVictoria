            <h2>Equestrianism</h2>
            <p>
                I have been an avid equestrian since 7 years old, and I am now a D2 in the USPC (United States Pony Club), specialized in the discipline of eventing (dressage, showjumping, and cross country). I currently ride at a barn named Centerline Riding Academy, and I have also been to The Stables at Magnolia Ridge, Storybook Farm, Deerfield Farm, and more. My current achievements include primarily jumping verticals up to the D3 height (I am in the process of gettind a D3 Certification) which is around 2'3'' and oxers around 20'' as well as cavaletti/crossrail lines, bending lines, and bounces. Cross country jumps I can successfully complete on a course are roll-tops, coops, brush fences, liverpools, and ditches. As for dressage, I have attended a show at Donida Farms and placed first, performing walk-trot-canter transitions and figures such as circles, quarter-turn-and-reverse, and leg-yields. I am currently working towards a D3 HM Certification, which is planned to be tested in about a month.

                Kudos to my instructors, who shaped the way I ride now: Erika Lee, Maya Huberman, and Amanda Hedgepeth. In appreciation my very first half-lease Welsh Cob pony, Lightning (US Enlighten), who colicked sadly but taught me how to jump over my first crossrail and cross country adventure, taught me how to sit a buck and fall off, and taught me how to control a bolting horse. I turned Lightning's colic story into a research project and presentation, where I won first place in the national USPC Research Project Fair in 2023. Then to Lucky (M-Gone West), an escape artist of sorts, that taught me to try my first brush jump and create a forward impulsion.
            </p>
            <p>And finally to my current horses: Jedi (Flea-Bitten Flyer) and Lily (Tiger Lily) who started me on my journey to the heights I can now reach.

            <h2>Robotics</h2>
            <p>
                Robotics was a secret passion I didn't know I had for a while, but nevertheless, one of my great interests. In 2nd grade, I started competing with a tight-knit group of peers for an underwater ROV Robotics competition. We learned all the features and functions of the robot, built and soldered the wires and control box from scratch and competed in the lowest division, Scout. This project was dropped for a while, until 7th grade again. In 6th grade, I participated in a FLL team where we competed against 17 other teams regionally, and we made it to finals. In 7th, we resumed the ROV Project, where I CEO'd the team, writing up all our robot feautres, testing and practicing two times a week, and got to 2nd place in the Navigator rank. Finally, now in 8th, I am co-captaining our FTC team to hopefully succussfully progress through League 1, League 2, and Interleagues.
